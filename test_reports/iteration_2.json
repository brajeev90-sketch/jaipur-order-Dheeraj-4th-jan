Rich Text Editor properly implemented with Tiptap using all required toolbar buttons (Bold, Italic, Underline, Highlight, Bullet Lists, Numbered Lists). Code analysis confirms proper integration in Add/Edit Item dialog. Browser automation testing limited by navigation challenges in test environment.",
